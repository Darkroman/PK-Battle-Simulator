# PK-Battle-Simulator
Welcome! This is just a small console based Pokemon battle simulator program. It does include all of generation 1's Pokemon and moves. There are no held items, abilities, or natures. IVs, EVs, and move attributes from generation 9 (or latest up to date mechanics based on Bulbapedia's information) are included. No dark, steel, or fairy typing, besides the move Bite.
As of right now, there is still no A.I system in place to play against a computer. I will include that in the future.

I started this project a long time ago and have been working on it off and on while also learning C++. I wanted to put what I've learned to practice, and Pokemon is one of my most cherished gaming series of all time.
I don't plan on making this into a full graphical game (as there are also some copyright issues with that in any case). Just something to put out there to show what I've learned so far. Along with future updates I hope to be more proficient at architectural/code organization design.
Hope you enjoy!
