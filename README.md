# PK-Battle-Simulator

# BUILD NOTES
My IDE of choice is Visual Studio, utilizing C++20 standard. Uploaded is a simple CMake build, as well as a binary release if you just want to download and play.

# GENERAL INFO
This is just a small console based Pokemon battle simulator program. I started this project a long time ago and have been working on it off and on while also learning C++. I wanted to put what I've learned to practice, and Pokemon is one of my most cherished gaming series of all time. I don't plan on making this into a full graphical game (as there are also some copyright issues with that in any case). Just something to put out there to show what I've learned so far. Along with future updates I hope to be more proficient at architectural/code organization design.

# FEATURES
- All of the generation 1 Pokemon
- All 165 moves and their respective secondary effects
- IVs, and EVs
- Mechanics are based on latest generation (except fairy, steel, and dark typing, besides the move "Bite")
- No natures, held items, or abilities.
- Physical/Special move split from gen 4 onward implemented.

# PLANNED UPDATES
- Add in a computer A.I
- Code architectural/organizational choices
- Not sure if I'll ever add in later generation stuff
